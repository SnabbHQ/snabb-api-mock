  description: "The Quote endpoint returns a price range for each product offered at a given location. The price
  estimate is provided as a formatted string with the full price range and the localized currency symbol.<br><br>The
  response also includes low and high estimates, and the [ISO 4217](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217) currency
  code for situations requiring currency conversion.\n

  <b>Warning:</b> Quotes have a valid limited duration of 10min. This is done to prevent un-expected costs if the time
  between the quote and the actual delivery order are to far apart. After this period, the quote won't be able to be
  used to create a new delivery."
